The internet is dangerous, and it is foolish to advise otherwise, but the internet is dangerous only in specific, well-understood ways. This guide aims to help you understand those ways.

This guide aims to give you a coherent model of security on the Internet. 

With a good model, you can separate reasonable fears from irrational ones.

<aside class="sidenote">
Eliezer S. Yudkowsky, an AI researcher, writes {% cite yudkowsky_2005 -A %} (emphasis in original):

> [In Karl] Popper's philosophy, the strength of a scientific theory is not how much it explains, but how much it *doesn't* explain. The virtue of a scientific theory lies not in the outcomes it permits, but in the outcomes it *prohibits*.

</aside>

At the end of this guide, you should have a good, falsifiable mental model of security on the Internet. This model shouldn't be that "the internet is safe" or "the internet is dangerous"; it should help you understand the *specific* things that are dangerous and things that are safe on the Internet because it describes how the Internet *actually* works---and nothing else {% cite pollard_2018 %}. 

If my article cannot help you make a prediction---like how safe it is to download an app on public Wi-Fi, for example---please let me know, and I will improve it.

With that, a warning:

## The caveat at the beginning

The warning above appears at the bottom of every page on this site. I am not a security professional; I am someone who studied the internet and knows how the pieces fit together. 

At the very least, this guide will show you how security on the internet works. Let's begin!
