It's hard to get good advice about internet security.

The internet is dangerous, and it is foolish to advise otherwise, but **the internet is dangerous only in specific, well-understood ways**. I wrote this guide to give you a coherent model of security on the internet: with a good model, you can separate reasonable fears from irrational ones.

Eliezer S. Yudkowsky, an AI researcher, writes {% cite yudkowsky_2005 -A %} (emphasis in original):

> [In Karl] Popper's philosophy, the strength of a scientific theory is not how much it explains, but how much it *doesn't* explain. The virtue of a scientific theory lies not in the outcomes it permits, but in the outcomes it *prohibits*.

So, my entreaty: this article aims to give you a good, falsifiable model. This model shouldn't be that "the internet is safe" or "the internet is dangerous"; it should help you understand the *specific* things that are dangerous and things that are safe on the internet because it describes how the internet *actually* works---and nothing else (see @pollard_2018). 

If my article cannot help you make a prediction---like how safe it is to download an app on public Wi-Fi, for example---please let me know, and I will improve it.

With that, a warning:

## A warning

This content is targeted at most internet users---to access your bank, online shopping, and Facebook.

If you fear censorship or your life may be at risk if you are hacked, it is reasonable to take other precautions. <!-- TODO: the first thing I always want to talk about is "threat model," but that's not useful -->

## The caveat at the beginning

The warning above appears at the bottom of every page on this site. I am not a security professional; I am someone who studied the internet and knows how the pieces fit together. 

I cannot claim to be anything more than I am, but I think it's important to share the things I know and the advice I have. I think it's helpful. I hope it helps you.

At the very least, this guide will show you how security on the internet works. Let's begin!
