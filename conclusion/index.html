	<p>If you ask security experts about the state of the world, they’ll probably say that everything is broken and everyone is hackable. Mozilla, in their <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/files/2015/05/HTTPS-FAQ.pdf">FAQ encouraging everyone to move to HTTPS</a> admits it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For all its flaws, the CA system we have is one that underpins the entire online economy we have today. It’s broken in ways[…]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The systems today have flaws. Attacks come out all the time, people write their passwords on Post-Its, and hackers make lots of money. There’s a lot of work to be done and a lot of holes to fill.</p>

<p>But that’s no cause for despair. The world economy relies on the encryption provided by HTTPS. Governments and militaries use the same encryption schemes you do when you check Facebook. These systems are battle-tested. Sure, people have attacked them since the day they were released, but hundreds, thousands of people dedicate their lives to fixing them up. They work every day to call out encryption schemes that <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/09/18/the-many-flaws-of-dualecdrbg/">seem fishy</a>. To invent new ones. To break the old ones. And to fight for online privacy and security for everyone.</p>

<p>I quoted Mozilla above, but I cut them off before their key point:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s broken in ways, but for the most part, it works.</p>
</blockquote>

<aside class="sidenote">
  <p>Or, to quote the illustrious <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1401_08-12_mickens.pdf">James Mickens</a>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Security research is the continual process of discovering that your spaceship is a deathtrap. However, as John F. Kennedy once said, “SCREW IT WE’RE GOING TO THE MOON.”</p>
  </blockquote>

</aside>

<p><strong>You <em>can</em> be safe, even on an open Wi-Fi network</strong>. It just takes some knowledge, some work, and some vigilance. And every day people are working to make sure it takes less and less of all of that.</p>

<p>Stay safe out there.</p>

<h2 id="bite-sized-takeaways">Bite-sized takeaways</h2>

<p>The most effective thing you can do to stay safe online is learn. But you can also take concrete action:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Always</em> use an auto-updating computer and browser.</li>
  <li>Use different passwords on each site, managed in a password manager.</li>
  <li>Use two-step authentication, especially on your email and bank accounts.</li>
  <li>Encrypt your hard drive.</li>
  <li>Lock your computer with a password or biometric security.</li>
  <li>Back up your data regularly.</li>
  <li>Type passwords only when you’re sure no one can see you.</li>
  <li>Trust your browser more than apps.</li>
  <li>Be suspicious when weird things happen.</li>
  <li>Learn how your browser communicates security: <a href="/https/">read</a> or <a href="https://youtu.be/RNzw8tVhOpY">watch</a>.</li>
</ol>
