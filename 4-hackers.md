If [staying secure](/secure) means protecting your data's confidentiality, integrity, and availability all of the time, then how do you do it?

It's overwhelming: are you *going* to get hacked?

## Have you been hacked today?

It sure seems like the Internet is on fire: your passwords have almost certainly leaked, Experian [probably leaked your Social Security number](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/equifax-hack-hits-credit-histories-of-up-to-143-million-americans/2017/09/07/a4ae6f82-941a-11e7-b9bc-b2f7903bab0d_story.html?utm_term=.144cd2c2c56a), and celebrities found their private photos stolen one by one [in 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICloud_leaks_of_celebrity_photos).

Hackers are everywhere (and [unstoppable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msX4oAXpvUE)), right?

## A guessing game

To set the tone, I ask you to think about your friends and family; the computer users around you. In the United States, how many computers do you think have spyware on them?

One in two? One in five? One in a twenty?

The number is probably less than one in 200.

Twice a year for over a decade, Microsoft has published the "Security Intelligence Report," an analysis of security data they collect across Windows. Within that data is information from the Malicious Software Removal Tool, a free downloadable program that scans (and removes) viruses and other malware.
