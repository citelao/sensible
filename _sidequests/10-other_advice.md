If you search for "is coffee shop wi-fi safe" on Google, you'll find many articles telling you that coffee shop wi-fi is dangerous.

All of this information---from earlier in the guide---helps you make these decisions better. But, with public wi-fi specifically, all the *other guides* preach caution. What makes this guide correct?

## A

If you search for "coffee shop wi-fi safe" on Google, you'll find many, many articles with tips and tricks to stay safe. Most of these articles trot out similar advice---be aware of sharing your email, use HTTPS, ensure you've turned off sharing, use a VPN---but the justifications differ<!-- https://lifehacker.com/how-to-stay-safe-on-public-wi-fi-networks-5576927 https://www.wired.com/story/public-wifi-safety-tips/ https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-wifi-the-dos-and-donts-of-using-public-wi-fi.html https://usa.kaspersky.com/resource-center/preemptive-safety/public-wifi https://www.quora.com/How-safe-is-WiFi-at-Starbucks-Is-SafeWeb-good https://www.purevpn.com/wifi-vpn/threats/evil-twin-attack https://www.ipass.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/iPass-2017-Mobile-Security-Report.pdf-->.

In fact, as you dig into the justifications, you may find them unsatisfying.

Ignoring the technical details of *how* you can be hacked on free wi-fi for a moment, there are other things that don't add up:

* Why would a hacker go to your coffee shop, hoping to steal your password? Given what we know hackers want---money, fast---is that the best use of their time? And isn't it hard to steal money with just a username and password?
* Are hackers intercepting passwords as I sign into banks? Or are they accessing my files on my computer before I send them? Or are they spoofing logon pages to get me to sign in? Or all of these things? What are hackers doing?
* If this type of hacking is so easy, why isn't everyone doing it? Why have I not noticed an attack yet?

Do these attacks even happen in real life?

## B

Indeed, all of these articles have a point.

But this is where the technical knowledge is helpful.

Almost all the threats you're worried about are protected with something called [HTTPS]({{site.baseurl}}/https/).

<aside class="sidenote">
Well, more accurately, SSL, which also can protect emails.
</aside>

## But what about the other threats?

If HTTPS fixes everything, then why doesn't the other advice say so? Indeed, if you bring up HTTPS to some other advisors, they will probably start listing off threats that HTTPS doesn't protect. Even I agree that HTTPS has its flaws.

It is easy to feel overwhelmed. Maybe coffee shop wi-fi isn't safe after all.

But notice that feeling of confusion. Take the same step back you did before, and ask the the same *non-technical* questions:

* Who is doing these attacks? What is their motivation?
* What are they using these attacks to do?
* Why isn't everyone performing these "easy" attacks?

How common are these *other* attacks?

Also, add one more question:

* If you knew about HTTPS ahead of time, why didn't you mention it up front?

## Lying doesn't look good on you

Browsing the Internet without some sort of protection is just like sending postcards in the mail for everyone to read.

But the Internet with HTTPS is like sending postcards in a locked box. Sure, locks can be picked and cut and opened---and sure, people can still read the address on the front---but "accessible to lock-picks" and "accessible to anyone at all" are very different things.

Anyone who claims that hackers can read your passwords on public wi-fi and then *walks that statement back* when you ask them about HTTPS is being disingenuous. At least.

This guide gives you the tools you need to assess other advice and recognize when it's unsatisfying, even if that advice is very technical or uses words you don't understand. You are not stupid. You may not know what a "man-in-the-middle attack" is, but you are qualified to guess the likelihood of some teenager trying it on you at Starbucks.

But a bit of technical knowledge can be helpful.

--- 

There are many programs and algorithms and protocols (beyond HTTPS) that help keep you safe on the Internet, some free and some not free. Learning more about how these systems work can only help you better decide that for yourself.


Unfortunately, technical detail can confuse?

Don't let salespeople try to tell you otherwise.
