## I don't think that word means what you think it means

Up till now, I've been using the term "hacker" loosely. Specifically, I've called anyone who wants your data a "hacker."

This illustrates a difference between common folks and security researchers. Most folks use the term loosely, to refer to almost any type of data breach (imagine saying "my Facebook got hacked" if you left it logged in to a public computer and someone posted on your timeline). But security researchers generally use "hacking" to mean breaking security with some sort of tool: think infecting computers with viruses, sending phishing emails, and scanning networks for vulnerabilities.

Similarly, we use "virus" to refer to what security researchers would call malware, of which viruses are only one type; there are also worms, spyware, ransomware, and more.

In other words, there's:

* "true" hacking---generally what you imagine a faceless TV show villain to do---and
* "folk" hacking---what most people are actually afraid of.

Your friend guessing your Facebook password, or an app accidentally deleting your files, or an ex finding your photos---or a stalker looking up your address on the Internet---are not "true" hacking.

This is an important distinction. Most security research focuses on "true" hacking, and hard evidence about "folk" hacking (that doesn't come from a survey) is hard to come by.

However, we have great data about "true" hacking, and it seems like most of the work to protect against that will protect against the other threats, too.

I'll go into a little more detail about "folk" hacking later, but from now on, I'll use the scientific definition of the word "hacking." I'll indicate if when I'm talking about folk hacking.
