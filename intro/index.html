<p>You know the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it safe to use coffee shop wi-fi?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The internet is safer today than it has ever been</strong>. Many people have been working their entire lives to make the internet safe, and their work is paying off.</p>

<p>Thanks to them, much of the internet is secure. Thanks to them, you probably have the tools to browse secure.</p>

<p>But the question remains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it safe to use coffee shop wi-fi?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The internet is a scary place</strong>. It is dangerous, it is new, it is a world that most people don’t understand. Hacking is so frequent that there are weekly newsletters summarizing new attacks. Every day, a new vulnerability; every day, a new  hack.</p>

<p>The internet is overwhelming. Staying safe seems unfathomable, especially when everything seems to break all the time. How can you protect yourself? What do you need to know?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it safe to use coffee shop wi-fi?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This question does have an answer. It’s a nuanced answer, with caveats and loopholes, but it is an answer. To learn the answer—the right answer, not a streamlined one—you need to understand the Internet.</p>

<p>That’s where this guide comes in. This is a guide for everyday people, people who use Excel at work, who buy stocks online, people whose idea of a good time is <em>not</em> reading the protocols that run the internet. <strong>Sensible people</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it safe to use coffee shop wi-fi?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Yes, probably</strong>. Armed with a few straightforward steps and a little knowledge, you can browse the web in peace.</p>

<p>Welcome to Sensible Security.</p>
