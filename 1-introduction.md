**The internet is safer today than it has ever been**. Many people have been working their entire lives to make the internet safe, and their work is paying off.

Thanks to them, much of the internet is secure. Thanks to them, you probably have the tools to browse secure.

But the question remains:

> Is it safe to use coffee shop wi-fi?

**The internet is a scary place**. It is dangerous, it is new, it is a world that most people don't understand. Hacking is so frequent that there are weekly newsletters summarizing new attacks. Every day, a new vulnerability; every day, a new  hack.

The internet is overwhelming. Staying safe seems unfathomable, especially when everything seems to break all the time. How can you protect yourself? What do you need to know?

> Is it safe to use coffee shop wi-fi?

This question has an answer. It's a nuanced answer, with caveats and loopholes, but it has an answer. To learn the answer—the right answer, not a streamlined one—you need to understand the internet.

That's where this guide comes in. This is a guide for everyday people, people who use Excel at work, who buy stocks online, people whose idea of a good time is *not* reading the protocols that run the internet. **Sensible people**.

> Is it safe to use coffee shop wi-fi?

## Staying safe on the internet

**It is possible to stay safe on the internet**. In fact, armed with a few straightforward steps and a little knowledge, you can browse the web in peace.

When you access secure websites on a secure computer, your traffic is automatically encrypted with some of the most well-tested security in the world.

**Public Wi-Fi has a unique set of dangers**, especially if your device is misconfigured or infected with a virus, but many of these dangers don't go away on private networks or with VPNs. These "mitigation strategies" provide certain security guarantees, but they are often redundant and are not the most effective steps you can take.

If you can guarantee your computer is healthy and your connection is secure---and it's pretty straightforward to check---you can use open Wi-Fi in peace.
