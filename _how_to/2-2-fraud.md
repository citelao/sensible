Identity theft is most people's #1 cyber-security concern, at least according to one survey<!-- 2010 NCSA / Norton by Symantec Online Safety Study -->.

Most identity theft gets resolved quickly. You have laws protecting you. Read your bank's terms and conditions & liability. Watching your bank statements may help, but your bank shoulders most of the liability, so they're probably watching closer than you are.

However, they do not care about your personal information, and you have to fight against new account fraud (I believe). Specifically, don't count on them to notify you. I don't know if you're liable for fraud.

You can prevent most new account fraud by freezing your credit, probably. So do that.

* Freeze your credit
* Understand your liability for your banks, debit cards, and credit cards. Choose your payment scheme based on liability.
* Watch your bank statements (but know your banks watch them, too)

See also Pew Americans & Cybersecurity, which has much higher fraud stats.
