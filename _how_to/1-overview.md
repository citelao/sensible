It's clear that [hackers target everyone]({{site.baseurl}}/hackers/) with easy, scalable attacks. It's also clear that [we don't have a good overall view]({{site.baseurl}}/how_hacked/) of all the ways they target us.

That being said, you are not powerless.

We might not know all the possible threats, but we know a lot about many of the biggest and most common ones. For example, we know approximately how many people encounter viruses while browsing the web, and we know how many people get phishing emails, and we know how many people get defrauded each year<!-- TODO link to my summary -->. Despite the holes in our data, it is still possible to give good security advice.

Good security advice must do at least these 2 things:

1. It must not claim to be complete (since it clearly can't be, if we don't know about all threats).
2. It must clearly articulate what it assumes and what it claims to do (since, if it's not complete, you need to know what it protects).<!-- TODO cite unfalsifiability of security claims to explain in more depth -->

Unfortunately, most security advice does not do either of these things. Most security advice is bad.

<aside class="sidenote">
That is not to say that most security advice is **wrong**. After all, you don't need a research study to notice that seatbelts keep you secure in many types of accidents.

But the people trying to sell you seatbelts should certainly have that study.
</aside>

Here are four evidence-based things you can do right now to make yourself more secure, and a few bits of common security advice that are probably useless.

This advice might not apply to you (though it probably does), and it's certainly not complete. But I explain what this advice protects you from and what it assumes. And, unlike the other guys, I have the disclaimer up front.


## Advice to take

1. Turn on [two-factor authentication]({{site.baseurl}}/passwords/) on your key accounts (at least email and finance).
2. [Freeze your credit]({{site.baseurl}}/identity_theft/) at the 3 largest credit bureaus.
3. Pay for and use [automatic backup software]({{site.baseurl}}/backups/).
4. Turn on automatic updates on your devices.

## Advice to avoid

1. **Don't** worry about [password strength]({{site.baseurl}}/passwords/) that much.
2. **Don't** pay money for [antivirus software]({{site.baseurl}}/antivirus/).
3. **Don't** use or pay money for a [VPN]({{site.baseurl}}/vpn/).

It's also clear that most of the biggest threats to your [security]({{site.baseurl}}/security/) lie with the companies that hold your data---your bank, your email providers, your social networks.

It may seem like protecting your data must be ridiculously easy or literally impossible. The truth is in the middle: some threats are easy to stop and some threats are impossible.

But you can take simple steps to mitigate all of these threats and reduce their impacts---even if you can't stop them completely.

Here are four *evidence-based* things you can do *right now* to make yourself more secure, and a few bits of common security advice that are probably useless.

## What?!

Some of this advice directly contradicts what you may have heard before.

Security advice is hard to give. A lot of it comes from earnest guesswork (and other places, too), but very little comes from real data. Furthermore, although it's easy to see when security advice is insufficient (you got hacked!), it's really hard to know when security advice is unnecessary<!-- Cormac Unfalsifiability -->.

How could you verify that, say, keeping your computer up-to-date is protecting you?

So advice creeps up; builds; compounds. Strong passwords! And VPNs! And HTTPS! And firewalls! And phishing awareness! And more and more and more.

We have data on how folks get hacked and how things get stolen. There are times when almost every piece of security advice is useful (even necessary!).

But if you only have limited energy to defend yourself, the most common advice we give can lead you the wrong way.

<aside class="sidenote">
After all, you're technically "safer" if you go around wearing a bullet-proof vest, but it's **probably** a waste of your money to buy and wear one. Plus it's heavy, and you'll look silly.
</aside>

These *evidence-based* suggestions are by no means complete, but they go a long way towards safeguarding you and your family. And some common advice just makes no sense given the threats we know about.

Point for point, here's why.

* credit freeze
* check your statements

## Bite-sized takeaways

The most effective thing you can do to stay safe online is learn. But you can also take concrete action:

1. *Always* use an auto-updating computer and browser.
2. Use different passwords on each site, managed in a password manager.
3. Use two-step authentication, especially on your email and bank accounts.
4. Encrypt your hard drive.
5. Lock your computer with a password or biometric security.
6. Back up your data regularly.
7. Type passwords only when you're sure no one can see you.
8. Trust your browser more than apps.
9. Be suspicious when weird things happen.
10. Learn how your browser communicates security: [read]({{site.baseurl}}/https/) or [watch](https://youtu.be/RNzw8tVhOpY).
