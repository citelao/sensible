TODO: let's not be so prescriptive.

It's clear that [hackers target everyone](/hackers/) and that they're focused on *easy*, [scalable](/how_hacked/) attacks.

It's also clear that most of the biggest threats to your [security](/security/) lie with the companies that hold your data---your bank, your email providers, your social networks.

It may seem like protecting your data must be ridiculously easy or literally impossible. The truth is in the middle: some threats are easy to stop and some threats are impossible.

But you can take simple steps to mitigate all of these threats and reduce their impacts---even if you can't stop them completely.

Here are four *evidence-based* things you can do *right now* to make yourself more secure, and a few bits of common security advice that are probably useless.

## Advice to take

1. Turn on [two-factor authentication](/passwords/) on your key accounts (at least email and finance).
2. [Freeze your credit](/identity_theft/) at the 3 largest credit bureaus.
3. Pay for and use [automatic backup software](/backups/).
4. Turn on automatic updates on your devices.

## Advice to avoid

1. **Don't** worry about [password strength](/passwords/) that much.
2. **Don't** pay money for [antivirus software](/antivirus/).
3. **Don't** use or pay money for a [VPN](/vpn/).

## What?!

Some of this advice directly contradicts what you may have heard before.

Security advice is hard to give. A lot of it comes from earnest guesswork (and other places, too), but very little comes from real data. Furthermore, although it's easy to see when security advice is insufficient (you got hacked!), it's really hard to know when security advice is unnecessary<!-- Cormac Unfalsifiability -->.

How could you verify that, say, keeping your computer up-to-date is protecting you?

So advice creeps up; builds; compounds. Strong passwords! And VPNs! And HTTPS! And firewalls! And phishing awareness! And more and more and more.

We have data on how folks get hacked and how things get stolen. There are times when almost every piece of security advice is useful (even necessary!).

But if you only have limited energy to defend yourself, the most common advice we give can lead you the wrong way.

<aside class="sidenote">
After all, you're technically "safer" if you go around wearing a bullet-proof vest, but it's **probably** a waste of your money to buy and wear one. Plus it's heavy, and you'll look silly.
</aside>

These *evidence-based* suggestions are by no means complete, but they go a long way towards safeguarding you and your family. And some common advice just makes no sense given the threats we know about.

Point for point, here's why.

* credit freeze
* check your statements
