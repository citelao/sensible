	<p>Passwords suck <a href="/references/#grassi2017nist">(Grassi et al., 2017, Appendix A)</a>.</p>

<p>So do password requirements. Not just because they’re annoying, but because they don’t improve security <a href="/references/#weir2010testing">(Weir, Aggarwal, Collins, &amp; Stern, 2010)</a>. Capital letters, special characters, changing them every 3 months: none of them really help.</p>

<p>They’re intended to make passwords “more random,” but humans are really bad at being random. Password requirements make it harder to create and remember good passwords.</p>

<p>How do you actually choose good passwords?</p>

<h2 id="a-nutshell">A nutshell</h2>

<p>In a nutshell, there are four steps to creating, protecting, and remembering good passwords:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Use a technique that generates random, but easy-to-remember passwords</strong>: I recommend the XKCD technique (described below), but there are others.</li>
  <li><strong>Turn on multi-factor authentication</strong>: do this for as many accounts as you can, especially the most important ones (like email and banks).</li>
  <li><strong>Use different passwords on different sites</strong>: at the very least, have different passwords for each important account (like email, each bank account, and your password manager).</li>
  <li><strong>Use a password manager</strong>: a password manager makes each of these steps much easier—and protects you from forgetting your passwords.</li>
</ul>

<p>These steps are basically written in order of importance, and each additional step you take makes you much safer. In fact, each step protects you against different types of attacks: a strong password makes it hard for attackers to guess their way into your accounts, but multi-factor authentication protects you if your password <em>does</em> leak.</p>

<p>With that being said, here’s how to generate secure passwords.</p>

<h2 id="were-bad-at-being-random">We’re bad at being random</h2>

<p>You need a good technique for generating passwords. In fact, you should almost never trust yourself to come up with “random” passwords.</p>

<p>Why? When told to choose randomly, people behave predictably.</p>

<p>For example, in 2015, a researcher named Julian Dunning found that 13 patterns (“8 characters and a year”) made up <a href="https://p16.praetorian.com/blog/statistics-will-crack-your-password-mask-structure">more than half</a> of all passwords in a dataset of 34 million real-world passwords.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://lorrie.cranor.org/pubs/longpass-chi2014.pdf">one study</a><!-- TODO proper citation -->, nearly 1 in 3 participants complied with a requirement to include a symbol by placing an <code class="highlighter-rouge">!</code> at the end of their password.</p>

<p>Relying on common passwords and common patterns, a reporter with Ars Technica <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/05/how-crackers-make-minced-meat-out-of-your-passwords/">cracked</a> more than half of 16,000 encrypted passwords in “a few hours” in 2015 (via <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/03/choosing_secure_1.html">Schneier</a>).</p>

<aside class="sidenote">
  <p>Note that Schneier believes my suggested password method is bad: <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/62832/is-the-oft-cited-xkcd-scheme-no-longer-good-advice">he’s wrong</a>. I get into the math later.</p>
</aside>

<p>Seriously: everyone is terrible at choosing passwords.</p>

<h2 id="completely-random-is-hard-though">Completely random is hard, though!</h2>

<p>The most obvious solution is to let computers—which are good at being “random”—do the work for you: have your computer generate a completely random series of letters and numbers.</p>

<p>These passwords are perfectly secure—in fact, they are much harder to guess than an XKCD technique password of the same length—but they are also much harder to remember.</p>

<aside class="sidenote">
  <p>Long sequences of random numbers and letters will always be the hardest passwords to guess.</p>
</aside>

<p>Surprisingly, it’s also important that your common passwords be memorable!</p>

<p>Think of how you use passwords: if they’re hard to remember, do you see yourself using different ones for each site? What if they were super-easy to remember? If they’re hard to remember, are you going to write them down on a Post-It? And sometimes (in emergencies) you need to share your passwords with other people. How do you plan on sharing <code class="highlighter-rouge">zdurqjwu</code>?</p>

<aside class="sidenote">
  <p>“OK, it’s ‘z’, ‘d’, ‘u’— no, ‘z’ as in ‘Zebra’!”</p>
</aside>

<p>In other words, because of how we remember things, some password-choosing techniques that may be <em>technically</em> better may make your life <em>less</em> secure. The best password advice should give you complex—hard-to-guess—passwords that stick in your brain.</p>

<h2 id="do-this--use-the-xkcd-technique">Do this — use the XKCD technique</h2>

<p>My favorite password generation technique is the <strong>XKCD technique</strong>, named after the <a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">webcomic that proposed it</a>.</p>

<aside class="sidenote">
  <p>Alternatively called <a href="http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html">Diceware</a>.</p>
</aside>

<ol>
  <li>Pick a (truly) random word from the dictionary. This can be done <a href="https://www.eff.org/dice">with dice</a> or with a good password manager.</li>
  <li>Repeat 3-5 more times.</li>
</ol>

<p>This pattern is fantastic because it generates easy-to-remember passwords, it’s hard to hack, and it’s easy to share with others in an emergency.</p>

<aside class="sidenote">
  <p>“Availability” is an important aspect of <a href="/secure/">security</a>!</p>
</aside>

<p>Again, long passwords made of truly random (as in, computer-generated or chosen-by-dice-roll) characters are the “most secure” passwords. If you can swing it, by all means use truly random passwords. But I think the XKCD technique walks a good line between “memorability” and “total randomness.”</p>

<h2 id="also--multi-factor-authentication-varied-passwords-and-password-managers">Also — multi-factor authentication, varied passwords, and password managers</h2>

<p>Before delving into the details of the technique (and why it’s secure), remember to <em>protect</em> your passwords (and to protect against the inevitability that they are hacked):</p>

<ul>
  <li>turn on <a href="/overall/#protect-you">multi-factor authentication</a> for as many accounts as you can</li>
  <li>use different passwords for each account</li>
  <li>use a password manager</li>
</ul>

<aside class="sidenote">
  <p>Seriously, set up multi-factor authentication for your email and banks now.</p>

  <p>It only takes a few minutes <strong>once</strong>. Do it now!</p>
</aside>

<p>It’s easy to get lost in the weeds and focus on generating the “best” password, but this doesn’t give you the best security.</p>

<p>These three steps offer important layers of protection against password hacking. See the complete <a href="/overall/">How to stay safe</a> guide for more detailed information about these steps.</p>

<h2 id="password-strength-and-the-xkcd-technique">Password strength and the XKCD technique</h2>

<p>The XKCD technique requires a little more justification. Why is it so much better to have a computer generate random words than to come up with random words yourself, or use words important to you, or important years, or names?</p>

<p>The strength of any password comes from how many possible passwords you <strong>could likely have chosen instead</strong>.</p>

<p>This makes sense when you consider what it takes to guess a password: if your friend Kim always uses the same password, it’s not hard to log in to her Facebook. Especially if she gave you her Hulu password.</p>

<p>In Kim’s case, there is only one likely possibility, so it is trivial to guess her password. If, instead, Kim chose a random lower-case letter for each password, there would be 26 possibilities to guess.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, hacking algorithms can randomly try <em>millions</em> of password possibilities per second on modern graphics cards, so you need a lot more randomness than a single random letter.</p>

<p>Modern guidelines don’t all agree on a number, but the <em>lowest</em> <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4086">suggests</a><!-- TODO cite properly --> choosing from at least 500 trillion possibilities. I think choosing from at least <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1e18+english+name">1 quintillion</a> is reasonable.</p>

<h2 id="measuring-entropy">Measuring entropy</h2>

<p>These numbers grow very quickly, to the point where I have to use words like “quintillion.” Security specialists prefer to measure the number of possibilities with entropy (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4086">RFC4086</a> sec. 2)<!-- TODO cite properly -->, which is measured in “bits.”</p>

<p>For our contexts, entropy is the <math>log<sub>2</sub></math> of the number of possibilities—the number of possibilities is <math>2<sup>entropy</sup></math>. In plain English, entropy is the “number of coin flips you would need to generate the same randomness.”</p>

<p>The entropy of a coin flip is 1; the entropy of a randomly-chosen lower-case letter is 4.7 (there are 26 possibilities; each coin flip has 2 possibilities; 4 coin flips mean 16 possiblities).</p>

<p>Modern password guidelines then ask for between 39-60 (and more) bits of entropy.<!-- TODO cite https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/69374/is-an-80-bit-password-good-enough-for-all-practical-purposes/69378 --></p>

<h2 id="strength-is-based-on-knowledge">Strength is based on knowledge</h2>

<p>You might have noticed that a password’s entropy—the number of possible passwords—varies based on how much you know about the password.</p>

<p>This makes it hard to calculate a password’s “true” entropy.</p>

<p>For example, what if you use your aunts’ names for all your passwords? <code class="highlighter-rouge">Natalie</code>, for example. A hacker assuming you are using a capitalized 7-letter word has 8 trillion possibilities—apparently your password has almost 33 bits of entropy! But a hacker might include common names in their dictionary. Natalie is one of the 200 most common names; only about 8 bits of entropy there. And if your little brother wants to vandalize your Facebook, he may know to try only immediate family members: maybe 30 people (5 bits) to try?</p>

<p>That’s why, when doing calculations, we like to assume that an attacker knows <em>everything</em> about how the password was chosen, except for the random step.</p>

<p>For example, if you use choose random family members for your passwords, assume the attacker knows you do that.</p>

<h2 id="knowledge-gives-them-nothing">Knowledge gives them nothing</h2>

<p>That’s why the XKCD technique is strong. Even if an attacker knows you used the technique, your password is still high entropy.</p>

<p>The comic itself <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/a/6096">limits itself</a> to the 2,000 most common words. Each word you pick adds about 11 bits of entropy. To generate a 60-bit password, all you need to do is choose 6 words completely randomly.</p>

<p>Diceware, or <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases">the EFF’s better wordlist</a>, ask you to roll 5 dice to pick each word, for about 13 bits of entropy per word.</p>

<p>Password managers often use even larger dictionaries. 1Password <a href="https://discussions.agilebits.com/discussion/56902/diceware-dictionary-size-and-feature-request">uses about 18,000</a> words, so ~14bits of entropy per word.</p>

<h2 id="the-technique-is-only-to-help-you-remember">The technique is only to help you remember</h2>

<p>If correctly calculated, entropy generated one way is the same as entropy generated another: 20 bits of entropy from random lower-case letters (~4.7bits each) is the same as 20 bits of entropy from dice-chosen words.</p>

<p>I argue that XKCD-technique–entropy is “better” because it’s much easier to remember:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">nitwit myopic fluke humanize</code>: ~56bits via 1Password’s dictionary</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">jvuzfyambktp</code>: ~56bits via random lower-case letters</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the difference between <a href="http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html">Diceware’s list</a> and <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases">the EFF’s list</a>: the EFF’s are designed to be easier to remember.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>At the end of the day, you need to balance making passwords hard to guess and making them easy to remember. The XKCD technique makes it easier to write “harder” passwords.</p>

<p>Equally-secure passwords made with random letters, numbers, and symbols can be a lot shorter, but are much harder to remember. At the end of the day, any password-generation technique works, as long as it generates enough entropy. When reading about new techniques, ask yourself: if a hacker knew I used this technique, how many guesses would they still need to make?</p>

<p>To generate good passwords, keep them secure, and remember them:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Use a technique that generates random, but easy-to-remember passwords</strong>: the XKCD technique is the most straightforward method I know.</li>
  <li><strong>Turn on multi-factor authentication</strong>: do this for as many accounts as you can, especially the most important ones (like email and banks).</li>
  <li><strong>Use different passwords on different sites</strong>: at the very least, have different passwords for each important account (like email, each bank account, and your password manager).</li>
  <li><strong>Use a password manager</strong>: a password manager makes each of these steps much easier—and protects you from forgetting your passwords.</li>
</ul>
