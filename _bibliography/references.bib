	url = {https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SoLongAndNoThanks.pdf},
	abstract = {It is often suggested that users are hopelessly lazy and unmotivated on security questions. They chose weak passwords, ignore security warnings, and are oblivious to certiﬁcates errors. We argue that users’ rejection of the security advice they receive is entirely rational from an economic perspective. The advice oﬀers to shield them from the direct costs of attacks, but burdens them with far greater indirect costs in the form of eﬀort. Looking at various examples of security advice we ﬁnd that the advice is complex and growing, but the beneﬁt is largely speculative or moot. For example, much of the advice concerning passwords is outdated and does little to address actual treats, and fully 100\% of certiﬁcate error warnings appear to be false positives. Further, if users spent even a minute a day reading URLs to avoid phishing, the cost (in terms of user time) would be two orders of magnitude greater than all phishing losses. Thus we ﬁnd that most security advice simply oﬀers a poor cost-beneﬁt tradeoﬀ to users and is rejected. Security advice is a daily burden, applied to the whole population, while an upper bound on the beneﬁt is the harm suﬀered by the fraction that become victims annually. When that fraction is small, designing security advice that is beneﬁcial is very hard. For example, it makes little sense to burden all users with a daily task to spare 0.01\% of them a modest annual pain.},

	abstract = {Home computer systems are insecure because they are administered by untrained users. The rise of botnets has ampliﬁed this problem; attackers compromise these computers, aggregate them, and use the resulting network to attack third parties. Despite a large security industry that provides software and advice, home computer users remain vulnerable. I identify eight ‘folk models’ of security threats that are used by home computer users to decide what security software to use, and which expert security advice to follow: four conceptualizations of ‘viruses’ and other malware, and four conceptualizations of ‘hackers’ that break into computers. I illustrate how these models are used to justify ignoring expert security advice. Finally, I describe one reason why botnets are so diﬃcult to eliminate: they cleverly take advantage of gaps in these models so that many home computer users do not take steps to protect against them.},

One percent of persons age 16 or older experienced the opening of a new account in their name or other misuse of personal information apart from misuse of an existing victim’s account. An estimated 12 percent of identity-theft victims had out-of-pocket losses of \$1.00 dollar or more; 88 percent either had no out-of-pocket losses or had losses of less than \$1.00. Fifty-five percent of identity-theft victims who resolved associated financial or credit problems related to their victimization did so in 1 day or less. Approximately 10 percent of identity-theft victims reported they experienced severe emotional distress as a result of the crime. An estimated 7 percent of identity-theft victims reported the crime to police. For counties that were in the surveyed sample in both 2014 and 2016, the portion of the population that experienced identity theft increased from 7 percent in 2014 to 10 percent in 2016. 35 tables and 6 figures},

We show that, at their core, many of the attacks in IPV contexts are technologically unsophisticated from the perspective of a security practitioner or researcher. For example, they are often carried out by a UI-bound adversary—an adversarial but authenticated user that interacts with a victim’s device or account via standard user interfaces—or by downloading and installing a ready-made application that enables spying on a victim. Nevertheless, we show how the sociotechnical and relational factors that characterize IPV make such attacks both extremely damaging to victims and challenging to counteract, in part because they undermine the predominant threat models under which systems have been designed. We discuss the nature of these new IPV threat models and outline opportunities for HCI research and design to mitigate these attacks.},

No one argues against the desirability of making security research more “scientiﬁc”. But how would one would go about that? We argue that making progress on this requires clarifying what “scientiﬁc” means in the context of computer security, and that has received too little attention. We pursue this based on a review of literature in the history and philosophy of science and a belief that work under the theme “Science and Security” should align with and ideally, beneﬁt from what has been learned over a few hundred years in science. We offer observations and insights, with a view that the security community can beneﬁt from better leveraging past lessons and common practices well-accepted by consensus in the mainstream scientiﬁc community—but which appear little recognized in the security community.},
