	url = {https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SoLongAndNoThanks.pdf},
	abstract = {It is often suggested that users are hopelessly lazy and unmotivated on security questions. They chose weak passwords, ignore security warnings, and are oblivious to certiﬁcates errors. We argue that users’ rejection of the security advice they receive is entirely rational from an economic perspective. The advice oﬀers to shield them from the direct costs of attacks, but burdens them with far greater indirect costs in the form of eﬀort. Looking at various examples of security advice we ﬁnd that the advice is complex and growing, but the beneﬁt is largely speculative or moot. For example, much of the advice concerning passwords is outdated and does little to address actual treats, and fully 100\% of certiﬁcate error warnings appear to be false positives. Further, if users spent even a minute a day reading URLs to avoid phishing, the cost (in terms of user time) would be two orders of magnitude greater than all phishing losses. Thus we ﬁnd that most security advice simply oﬀers a poor cost-beneﬁt tradeoﬀ to users and is rejected. Security advice is a daily burden, applied to the whole population, while an upper bound on the beneﬁt is the harm suﬀered by the fraction that become victims annually. When that fraction is small, designing security advice that is beneﬁcial is very hard. For example, it makes little sense to burden all users with a daily task to spare 0.01\% of them a modest annual pain.},

	abstract = {Home computer systems are insecure because they are administered by untrained users. The rise of botnets has ampliﬁed this problem; attackers compromise these computers, aggregate them, and use the resulting network to attack third parties. Despite a large security industry that provides software and advice, home computer users remain vulnerable. I identify eight ‘folk models’ of security threats that are used by home computer users to decide what security software to use, and which expert security advice to follow: four conceptualizations of ‘viruses’ and other malware, and four conceptualizations of ‘hackers’ that break into computers. I illustrate how these models are used to justify ignoring expert security advice. Finally, I describe one reason why botnets are so diﬃcult to eliminate: they cleverly take advantage of gaps in these models so that many home computer users do not take steps to protect against them.},

An estimated 12 percent of identity-theft victims had out-of-pocket losses of \$1.00 dollar or more; 88 percent either had no out-of-pocket losses or had losses of less than \$1.00. Fifty-five percent of identity-theft victims who resolved associated financial or credit problems related to their victimization did so in 1 day or less. Approximately 10 percent of identity-theft victims reported they experienced severe emotional distress as a result of the crime. An estimated 7 percent of identity-theft victims reported the crime to police.

We show that, at their core, many of the attacks in IPV contexts are technologically unsophisticated from the perspective of a security practitioner or researcher. For example, they are often carried out by a UI-bound adversary—an adversarial but authenticated user that interacts with a victim’s device or account via standard user interfaces—or by downloading and installing a ready-made application that enables spying on a victim. Nevertheless, we show how the sociotechnical and relational factors that characterize IPV make such attacks both extremely damaging to victims and challenging to counteract, in part because they undermine the predominant threat models under which systems have been designed. We discuss the nature of these new IPV threat models and outline opportunities for HCI research and design to mitigate these attacks.},
