	abstract = {It is often suggested that users are hopelessly lazy and unmotivated on security questions. They chose weak passwords, ignore security warnings, and are oblivious to certiﬁcates errors. We argue that users’ rejection of the security advice they receive is entirely rational from an economic perspective. The advice oﬀers to shield them from the direct costs of attacks, but burdens them with far greater indirect costs in the form of eﬀort. Looking at various examples of security advice we ﬁnd that the advice is complex and growing, but the beneﬁt is largely speculative or moot. For example, much of the advice concerning passwords is outdated and does little to address actual treats, and fully 100\% of certiﬁcate error warnings appear to be false positives. Further, if users spent even a minute a day reading URLs to avoid phishing, the cost (in terms of user time) would be two orders of magnitude greater than all phishing losses. Thus we ﬁnd that most security advice simply oﬀers a poor cost-beneﬁt tradeoﬀ to users and is rejected. Security advice is a daily burden, applied to the whole population, while an upper bound on the beneﬁt is the harm suﬀered by the fraction that become victims annually. When that fraction is small, designing security advice that is beneﬁcial is very hard. For example, it makes little sense to burden all users with a daily task to spare 0.01\% of them a modest annual pain.},
