	<p>It’s hard to get good advice about internet security.</p>
<p>The internet is dangerous, and it is foolish to advise otherwise, but <strong>the internet is dangerous only in specific, well-understood ways</strong>. I wrote this guide to give you a coherent model of security on the internet: with a good model, you can separate reasonable fears from irrational ones.</p>
<p>Eliezer S. Yudkowsky, an AI researcher, writes <a href="/references/#yudkowsky_2005">(2005)</a> (emphasis in original):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[In Karl] Popper’s philosophy, the strength of a scientific theory is not how much it explains, but how much it <em>doesn’t</em> explain. The virtue of a scientific theory lies not in the outcomes it permits, but in the outcomes it <em>prohibits</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, my entreaty: this article aims to give you a good, falsifiable model. This model shouldn’t be that “the internet is safe” or “the internet is dangerous”; it should help you understand the <em>specific</em> things that are dangerous and things that are safe on the internet because it describes how the internet <em>actually</em> works—and nothing else <a href="/bibliography/pollard_2018.html">Details</a>.</p>
<p>If my article cannot help you make a prediction—like how safe it is to download an app on public Wi-Fi, for example—please let me know, and I will improve it.</p>
<p>With that, a warning:</p>
<h2 id="a-warning">A warning</h2>
<p>This content is targeted at most internet users—to access your bank, online shopping, and Facebook.</p>
<p>If you fear censorship or your life may be at risk if you are hacked, it is reasonable to take other precautions. <!-- TODO: the first thing I always want to talk about is "threat model," but that's not useful --></p>
<h2 id="the-caveat-at-the-beginning">The caveat at the beginning</h2>
<p>The warning above appears at the bottom of every page on this site. I am not a security professional; I am someone who studied the internet and knows how the pieces fit together.</p>
<p>I cannot claim to be anything more than I am, but I think it’s important to share the things I know and the advice I have. I think it’s helpful. I hope it helps you.</p>
<p>At the very least, this guide will show you how security on the internet works. Let’s begin!</p>
