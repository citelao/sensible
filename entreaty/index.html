	<p>The internet is dangerous, and it is foolish to advise otherwise, but the internet is dangerous only in specific, well-understood ways. This guide aims to help you understand those ways.</p>

<p>This guide aims to give you a coherent model of security on the Internet.</p>

<p>With a good model, you can separate reasonable fears from irrational ones.</p>

<aside class="sidenote">
  <p>Eliezer S. Yudkowsky, an AI researcher, writes <a href="/references/#yudkowsky_2005">(2005)</a> (emphasis in original):</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>[In Karl] Popper’s philosophy, the strength of a scientific theory is not how much it explains, but how much it <em>doesn’t</em> explain. The virtue of a scientific theory lies not in the outcomes it permits, but in the outcomes it <em>prohibits</em>.</p>
  </blockquote>

</aside>

<p>At the end of this guide, you should have a good, falsifiable mental model of security on the Internet. This model shouldn’t be that “the internet is safe” or “the internet is dangerous”; it should help you understand the <em>specific</em> things that are dangerous and things that are safe on the Internet because it describes how the Internet <em>actually</em> works—and nothing else <a href="/references/#pollard_2018">(Pollard, 2018)</a>.</p>

<p>If my article cannot help you make a prediction—like how safe it is to download an app on public Wi-Fi, for example—please let me know, and I will improve it.</p>

<p>With that, a warning:</p>

<h2 id="a-warning">A warning</h2>

<p>This content is targeted at most internet users—to access your bank, online shopping, and Facebook.</p>

<p>If you fear censorship or your life may be at risk if you are hacked, it is reasonable to take other precautions.</p>

<p>Also, this content is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind, express or
implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability,

liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from,
out of or in connection with this content or the use or other dealings in
this content.</p>

<aside class="sidenote">
  <p>And some legalese. Use your best judgement with this information.</p>
</aside>

<h2 id="the-caveat-at-the-beginning">The caveat at the beginning</h2>

<p>The warning above appears at the bottom of every page on this site. I am not a security professional; I am someone who studied the internet and knows how the pieces fit together.</p>

<p>At the very least, this guide will show you how security on the internet works. Let’s begin!</p>
