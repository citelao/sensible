The data we send across the Internet every day---emails, YouTube videos, and search results---is immensely valuable to hackers, governments, employers, advertisers, and snoopy family members.

Security means protecting this data.

## Protect your confidentiality, integrity, and availability

Specifically, "protecting your data" means protecting these three things about it:

* **Confidentiality**: no one can access your data if you don't want them to.
* **Integrity**: no one can change your data if you don't want them to.
* **Availability**: no one can deny you access to your data when you want it.

This is the "CIA triad," and it represents the three fundamental guarantees you need to consider your data "safe."

<aside class="sidenote">
Some analysts like to add more guarantees, like "non-repudiation"---that no one can deny they sent you something---but the CIA triad is still [the "basis" for information security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_triad).
</aside>

Furthermore, security means protecting these guarantees **everywhere and all the time**.

This explains why it often feels so futile trying to secure your computer. You may have worked to secure your computer before, perhaps with antivirus software, a firewall, or a spam filter, but these are piecemeal solutions to a more general problem: they protect only some parts of your data some of the time.

To be truly safe, you must protect your data's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. All of it, all of the time.

## Why does security matter?

But why? That may seem like a "silly" question, but it's a really good point: if no one is being hacked, staying "secure" doesn't really matter.

Trying to stay secure without knowing what it means is like adding deadbolts to your front door **when criminals will just break a window**<!-- TODO we have citations for this! -->. Trying to stay secure without knowing why it matters is like adding a deadbolt **without knowing if you have anything in your house**.

I find it helpful to reframe "security" and the CIA triad in terms of practical outcomes. **What are you scared of on the Internet?**

I've found that most people are worried about the same things<!-- TODO cite folk models -->:

* hackers stealing your money,
* hackers taking (or changing or deleting) your stuff, and
* hackers hurting the people you care about.

*This* is what you protect against by securing your computer.

## All about the Benjamins, baby

This list of fears is great because it also matches what *hackers* want.

The Internet is complex and new; **perhaps there is other "bad stuff" that can happen to you**, that you don't even know to defend against.

It turns out, **hackers want money**.

Every year, Verizon publishes a massive data breach report<!-- TODO cite -->---a report examining thousands of successful "hacks" across thousands of businesses. And every year they've measured, it's clear that criminals are mostly after money.

<aside class="sidenote">
Or, in Verizon's words:

> So why do the Actors do what they do? Money, loot, cash, filthy lucre,
greed... get the idea?
</aside>

**Almost all data breaches are financially-motivated or espionage** (corporate or government-affiliated). Hacking for fun, ideology, or grudge all trail distantly behind<!-- TODO cite -->.

There may have been a time when most hackers did it for the "fun" of it, but that's not the case today. Today, hackers are just like your average brick-and-mortar criminal.

## Just like real life!

The Internet provides crazy new opportunities for criminals to hack you, but hackers usually have straightforward goals: goals that you can understand. Goals you can prepare against.

It's worth thinking about what scares *you*. Everyone is different, and everyone has different things they want to protect. Once you know what you're afraid *of*, you can begin to protect against it.

But there remains an open question. Am I target?

I mentioned earlier that trying to stay secure without knowing what it means or why you're doing it is like trying to secure your home with a deadbolt when criminals might just use the window or avoid your house entirely.

Trying to stay secure without knowing what the threats are is like trying to secure your house with a deadbolt when **criminals might not even exist**.

So with that, it's worth asking: "will I even be hacked?"
