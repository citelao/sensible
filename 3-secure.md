The data we send across the Internet every day---emails, YouTube videos, and search results---is immensely valuable to hackers, governments, employers, advertisers, and snoopy family members.

Security means protecting this data.

## Protect your confidentiality, integrity, and availability

Specifically, "protecting your data" means protecting these three things about it:

* **Confidentiality**: no one can access your data if you don't want them to.
* **Integrity**: no one can change your data if you don't want them to.
* **Availability**: no one can deny you access to your data when you want it.

This is the "CIA triad," and it represents the three fundamental guarantees you need to consider your data "safe."

<aside class="sidenote">
Some analysts like to add more guarantees, like "non-repudiation"---that no one can deny they sent you something---but the CIA triad is still [the "basis" for information security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_triad).
</aside>

Furthermore, security means protecting these guarantees **everywhere and all the time**.

This explains why it often feels so futile trying to secure your computer. You may have worked to secure your computer before, perhaps with antivirus software, a firewall, or a spam filter, but these are piecemeal solutions to a more general problem: they protect only some parts of your data some of the time.

To be truly safe, you must protect your data's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. All of it, all of the time.

## Why does security matter?

Security isn't important if it can't affect you. And it's worth considering: maybe hackers have nothing to gain from "ordinary" folks.

I've found that most people are worried about the same things<!-- TODO cite folk models -->:

* hackers stealing your money,
* hackers taking (or changing or deleting) your stuff, and
* hackers hurting the people you care about.

"Security" and the CIA triad can seem very abstract, but *these* fears are concrete. *This* is what you protect against by securing your computer.

## Hackers want your money

These worries are rational. **It turns out, hackers *do* want your money**.

This can be reassuring if you worry you don't know what hackers could possibly take from you. There are many things to hack and many ways to hack them, but at the end of the day criminals want your money.

Every year, Verizon publishes a massive report examining thousands of successful data breaches across thousands of businesses<!-- TODO cite -->. And every year, it's clear: **almost all data breaches are financially-motivated or for espionage** (corporate and government-affiliated). Hacking for fun, ideology, or grudge all trail distantly behind<!-- TODO cite -->.

<aside class="sidenote">
Or, in Verizon's words:

> So why do the Actors do what they do? Money, loot, cash, filthy lucre,
greed... get the idea?
</aside>

There may have been a time when most hackers did it for the "fun" of it, but that's not the case today. Today, hackers are just like your average brick-and-mortar criminal.

## Just like real life!

Hackers usually have straightforward goals: goals that you can understand. Goals you can prepare against.

Security is nice, but only if it helps *you*. Think about what you want to protect against. Everyone is different, and everyone has different things they want to protect. Once you know what you're afraid *of*, you can begin to protect against it.

But there remains an open question. Am I target?

Trying to stay secure without knowing what it means is like trying to secure your home with a deadbolt when criminals will just break a window, but trying to stay secure without knowing what the threats are is like trying to secure your house with a deadbolt when criminals might not even exist.

So with that, it's worth asking: "will I even be hacked?"
