The data we send across the Internet every day---emails, YouTube videos, and search results---is immensely valuable to hackers, governments, employers, advertisers, and snoopy family members.

Security means protecting this data.

## Protect your confidentiality, integrity, and availability

Specifically, "protecting your data" means protecting these three things about it:

* **Confidentiality**: no one can access your data if you don't want them to.
* **Integrity**: no one can change your data if you don't want them to.
* **Availability**: no one can deny you access to your data when you want it.

This is the "CIA triad," and it represents the three fundamental guarantees you need to consider your data "safe."

<aside class="sidenote">
Some analysts like to add more guarantees, like "non-repudiation"---that no one can deny they sent you something---but the CIA triad is still [the "basis" for information security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_triad).
</aside>

Furthermore, security means protecting these guarantees **everywhere and all the time**.

This explains why it often feels so futile trying to secure your computer. You may have worked to secure your computer before, perhaps with antivirus software, a firewall, or a spam filter, but these are piecemeal solutions to a more general problem: they protect only some parts of your data some of the time.

To be truly safe, you must protect your data's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. All of it, all of the time.

## "All of the time" is overwhelming

That's hard, especially since most of your data probably lives on servers in "the cloud."

If antivirus software, firewalls, and spam filters used haphazardly aren't enough, what is? What's at risk when you browse the Internet? What can hackers do with your data?

An earlier version of this guide dove straight into how the Internet work, and what you can do to protect yourself, but there's a deeper question:

What do hackers do, and why?

Are you a likely target to be hacked?
