The data we send across the Internet every day---emails, YouTube videos, and search results---is immensely valuable to hackers, governments, employers, advertisers, and snoopy family members.

Security means protecting this data.

## Protect your confidentiality, integrity, and availability

Specifically, "protecting your data" means protecting these three things about it:

* **Confidentiality**: no one can access your data if you don't want them to.
* **Integrity**: no one can change your data if you don't want them to.
* **Availability**: no one can deny you access to your data when you want it.

This is the "CIA triad," and it represents the three fundamental guarantees you need to consider your data "safe."

<aside class="sidenote">
Some analysts like to add more guarantees, like "non-repudiation"---that no one can deny they sent you something---but the CIA triad is still [the "basis" for information security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_triad).
</aside>

Furthermore, security means protecting these guarantees **everywhere and all the time**.

This explains why it often feels so futile trying to secure your computer. You may have worked to secure your computer before, perhaps with antivirus software, a firewall, or a spam filter, but these are piecemeal solutions to a more general problem: they protect only some parts of your data some of the time.

To be truly safe, you must protect your data's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. All of it, all of the time.

## But does it matter?

Of course, what can happen if your data is insecure? Sure, perhaps you could [lose everything](https://www.wired.com/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/), but will that happen to you? There's a ton of data in the world, and much of that is trivial ("Oh no! You can pay my library fines!" for example).

On the whole, I've found that the scariest things are:

* hackers stealing your money,
* hackers taking (or changing or deleting) your stuff, and
* hackers hurting the people you care about.

These "scary things" illustrate why it's important to safeguard (at least some of) your data. It should be easy to think of how hackers could target your data's different triad attributes----confidentiality, integrity, and availability---to steal, trick, or extort you.

However, I find that *de-escalates* the problem, as well. The modern world can seem like a world of shadowy threats. But they're not shadowy! You know what you're trying to protect; you know what's important to you.

By articulating the fear, you can take prioritize the important steps.

## Security all up

I will always advocate good security hygiene at all times, and I would never suggest you ignore a reasonable security precaution. This is largely because it's *really* hard to know what data is (and which  accounts are) important to keep safe.

To take the library example again: a hacker might not be able to do much with your library card directly, but a motivated hacker could look at your checkout history to build a phishing attack ("Yeah, it's me, Freddie---you know, the guy who reads a lot of sci-fi? Can you buzz me in today?").

Sure, it's a stretch, but it's hard to tell what's "outrageous" and what's "brilliant" until after it's too late to change your mind.

That being said, some security steps are much more important than others, and you can take those steps to vastly improve your own security.

Understanding those steps takes knowing what hackers actually target, and why.
