The data we send across the Internet every day---emails, YouTube videos, and search results---is immensely valuable to hackers, governments, employers, advertisers, and snoopy family members.

Security means protecting this data.

## Protect your confidentiality, integrity, and availability

Specifically, "protecting your data" means protecting these three things about it:

* **Confidentiality**: no one can access your data if you don't want them to.
* **Integrity**: no one can change your data if you don't want them to.
* **Availability**: no one can deny you access to your data when you want it.

This is the "CIA triad," and it represents the three fundamental guarantees you need to consider your data "safe."

<aside class="sidenote">
Some analysts like to add more guarantees, like "non-repudiation"---that no one can deny they sent you something---but the CIA triad is still [the "basis" for information security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_triad).
</aside>

Furthermore, security means protecting these guarantees **everywhere and all the time**.

This explains why it often feels so futile trying to secure your computer. You may have worked to secure your computer before, perhaps with antivirus software, a firewall, or a spam filter, but these are piecemeal solutions to a more general problem: they protect only some parts of your data some of the time.

To be truly safe, you must protect your data's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. All of it, all of the time.

## What does security do for me?

It's nice to know what "security" means, concretely, but it still leaves the question: why does it matter if I'm secure or not?

I find it helpful to reframe "security" and the CIA triad in terms of practical outcomes. **What are you scared of on the Internet?**

On the whole, security protects against three types of "scary things":

* hackers stealing your money,
* hackers taking (or changing or deleting) your stuff, and
* hackers hurting the people you care about.

With these "scary things" spelled out, it should be easier to see how hackers could target your data's security---its confidentiality, integrity, or availability---to steal, trick, or extort you.

It's worth thinking about what scares *you*. Everyone is different, and everyone has different things they want to protect. Once you know what you're afraid *of*, you can begin to protect against it.

## "Did I miss anything?"

The Internet is hard to define and hard to understand sometimes, and that makes it hard to list its dangers. A lot of people are scared of "bad" stuff happening, without being sure what that could be. Is there something new that hackers want to take from me, that you don't know about?

That's what I like about this list of "scary things." It matches what hackers want.

Every year, Verizon publishes a massive data breach report---a report examining thousands of successful "hacks" across thousands of businesses. For a decade, about 90% of these breaches are financially-motivated or espionage, with these financially-motivated breaches making up more than 2 out of 3 breaches overall. Hacking for fun, ideology, or grudge all trail distantly behind<!-- TODO cite -->.

In other words, hackers want to steal money from you, or they want to steal your secrets.

There may have been a time when most hackers did it for the "fun" of it, but that's not the case today. That's good: if you think of hackers as "criminals, but on the Internet," you're not too far off. Hackers are just like brick-and-mortar criminals. They're trying to steal from you.

<!-- security gives you piece of mind. "I love that my spam detector [detects spammy extortion emails]" -->

<!-- getting "looped in" to criminal syndicates -->

<!-- include "spelled out" dangers -->

## But does it matter?

Knowing what "secut

Of course, what can happen if your data is insecure? Sure, perhaps you could [lose everything](https://www.wired.com/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/), but will that happen to you? There's a ton of data in the world, and much of that is trivial ("Oh no! You can pay my library fines!" for example).

On the whole, I've found that the scariest things are:

* hackers stealing your money,
* hackers taking (or changing or deleting) your stuff, and
* hackers hurting the people you care about.

These "scary things" illustrate why it's important to safeguard (at least some of) your data. It should be easy to think of how hackers could target your data's different triad attributes----confidentiality, integrity, and availability---to steal, trick, or extort you.

## What am I *not* afraid of?

But articulating these concrete threats doesn't always feel like enough: with the Internet so vast, it can be easy to worry about what you're *not* protecting against.


However, I find that *de-escalates* the problem, as well. The modern world can seem like a world of shadowy threats. But they're not shadowy! You know what you're trying to protect; you know what's important to you.

By articulating the fear, you can take prioritize the important steps.

## Security all up

I will always advocate for good security hygiene at all times, and I would never suggest you ignore a reasonable security precaution. This is largely because it's *really* hard to know what data is (and which  accounts are) important to keep safe.

To take the library example again: a hacker might not be able to do much with your library card directly, but a motivated hacker could look at your checkout history to build a phishing attack ("Yeah, it's me, Freddie---you know, the guy who reads a lot of sci-fi? Can you buzz me in today?").

Sure, it's a stretch, but it's hard to tell what's "outrageous" and what's "brilliant" until after it's too late to change your mind.

That being said, some security steps are much more important than others, and you can take those steps to vastly improve your own security.

Understanding those steps takes knowing what hackers actually target, and why.
