	<h2>Why is this guide free?</h2>
	<p>
		The short answer: because <strong>my friends are scared</strong>. I
		wrote this for them (and my mom).
	</p>
	<p>
		The long answer: I've been learning about networking (and security) long
		enough to feel safe on the internet myself, but I realized that
		<strong>my friends had no clue how to be safe</strong>! They were paying
		attention to the news and generic "security advice" (not all of it good),
		but still they didn't feel secure.
	</p>
	<p>
		They were right: <strong>they were not secure</strong>. They started
		asking me for help, and I realized I needed better information. I
		started reading and researching; I shared what I learned. Then I wrote
		it down.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I thought about it, I realized that tons of people feel the same
		way: scared and eager to learn, but unsure where to start. They are my
		friends, my family, and my colleagues.
	</p>
	<p>
		I saw other security advice, and I thought mine would be helpful. So I
		decided to share it with everyone. Besides, I trust strangers with my
		credit card information all the time. <strong>If I share this guide for
		free, maybe those strangers will read it and keep my money safe
		</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
		So friends, family, strangers, here it is: Sensible Security.
