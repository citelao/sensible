The data we send across the Internet every day---emails, YouTube videos, and search results---is immensely valuable to hackers, governments, employers, advertisers, and snoopy family members.

Security means protecting this data.

## Protect your confidentiality, integrity, and availability

Specifically, "protecting your data" means protecting these three things about it:

* **Confidentiality**: no one can access your data if you don't want them to.
* **Integrity**: no one can change your data if you don't want them to.
* **Availability**: no one can deny you access to your data when you want it.

This is the "CIA triad," and it represents the three fundamental guarantees you need to consider your data "safe."

<aside class="sidenote">
Some analysts like to add more guarantees, like "non-repudiation"---that no one can deny they sent you something---but the CIA triad is still [the "basis" for information security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_triad).
</aside>

Furthermore, security means protecting these guarantees **everywhere and all the time**.

This explains why it often feels so futile trying to secure your computer. You may have worked to secure your computer before, perhaps with antivirus software, a firewall, or a spam filter, but these are piecemeal solutions to a more general problem: they protect only some parts of your data some of the time.

To be truly safe, you must protect your data's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. All of it, all of the time.

## Bringing it to the real world

The CIA triad describes abstract concepts. It's worth thinking about what security means for you and the people you care about. Security, after all, means nothing if you're not protecting things for a reason.

I've found that most people are worried about the same things<!-- TODO cite folk models -->:

* hackers stealing your money,
* hackers taking (or changing or deleting) your stuff, and
* hackers hurting the people you care about.

"Security" and the CIA triad can seem very abstract, but *these* fears are concrete. *This* is what you protect against by securing your computer. Think about what you want to protect. It can help you decide what precautions to take.

After all: you can't protect anything if you don't know what you're guarding.

## Does security impact you?

But there remains an open question. Am I target?

You know what's important to you, but maybe it's not important to hackers. Do people really want to know your Netflix password, or home address, or phone number, or family photos? If hackers steal your data, what impact will it have on you?

So with that: "will I even be hacked?"
