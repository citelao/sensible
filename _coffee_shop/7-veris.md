The seven actions in the VERIS schema (hacking, malware, social, misuse, physical, error, and environmental), which we discussed in the [the last section]({{site.baseurl}}/how_hacked/), give a high-level overview of cybersecurity threats. But it's worth re-examining some of the "well-known" ones.

There's a lot of surprising facts about hacking, malware, and social attacks.

## This may not be the big picture

If you're worried about your cybersecurity today, you're probably worried about these three attacks specifically.

Researchers worry about the same things, and that comes out in the research. Most consumer cybersecurity research revolves around these three attacks, and it's very hard to find data about the others in a way that feels complete.

There are probably surprising and brilliant insights hidden in the data for the other 4 actions in the VERIS schema, but I don't have that data---maybe nobody does.

Regardless, let's examine the data we have.

## The key word is "scalable"

If there's a mantra to be had from the previous sections, it's that most cybercriminals aim for scalable attacks---out of necessity. If cybercrime is about money, then the attacks need to make a bunch of money at once (very hard) or make a little bit of money many times.

Most of the insights here stem from applying that rule of thumb to different attacks.

It's worth jumping back to the point we made at the beginning---most of our data only covers the first 3 actions in the VERIS schema:

* hacking,
* malware, and
* phishing.

The data shows that---though both malware and phishing are *common*---none of them are as common as most people think.

There are still 4 other actions in the VERIS schema:

* misuse,
* physical,
* error, and
* environmental.

Each of them can be scaled in different ways. We don't have a lot of data about these attacks.

But you can begin to apply the rule of thumb to these, too---even subjectively. When was the last time you sent an email to the wrong person (error)? Last week? How often do friends start thumbing through your other pictures when you show them one on your phone (misuse)?

We don't do a good job of measuring these things objectively, and it's hard to learn from the data until then. It could be that a product that stops you from emailing the wrong Dan is more valuable than the most expensive anti-virus software.

But we don't know.
