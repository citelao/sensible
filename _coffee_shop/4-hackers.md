Hackers target everyone.

That's the easy answer, and it's true. There *are* cyber-criminals who are after your money, and they target everyone on the Internet.

But it's not the whole answer. Yes, hacking attempts are common, but they're probably less scary than you imagine. And the impact of a "successful" hack may be less catastrophic than you think. Here's why.

## Learning from mistakes

In 2004, the Internet Storm Center wrote that an unpatched Windows XP machine would be infected [within 20 minutes](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/08/19/infected_in20_minutes/) of being connected to the Internet. This is easy to believe. Windows XP:

* had no default firewall (it allowed anyone to connect to it without issue),
* had poor built-in security software (so it could not stop threats once they connected), and it
* had notoriously insecure default settings (so hackers had many ways to take over your machine).

Microsoft eventually released patches (the "Service Packs") that turned on the firewall and fixed many of the bad defaults, but the damage was done. Securing a new XP machine meant hoping you could download the patches before you got a virus.

That's not really the case today.

Microsoft learned their lesson, and new versions of Windows are built to be "secure by default"---safe from hackers until you *disable* protection in some way. In fact, more importantly, the rest of the Internet learned their lesson, too. Since 2004, Google, Verizon, your Internet Security Providers, and your banks have all spent billions making the internet safer. Thousands of people dedicate their lives to protecting your computer and fighting back against hackers.

In 2014, a team<!-- cite How Vulnerable Are Unprotected Machines on the Internet? --> set out to reproduce the Interet Storm Center's findings. They were fairly successful: their obsolete Windows XP machines got hacked within a few days. But their modern machines---running Windows 7---were never infected and never hacked.

Those newer machines were just harder to hack.

## Hackers go for the easy stuff

"Harder to hack" explains a lot about cybersecurity---and what it means for you.

In general, you can divide hacking into two categories:

1. Scalable, easy-to-automate, low effort attacks, and
2. Targeted, in-depth, high effort attacks.

This is not because there are two "ways" to hack (there are actually many!), but more because it explains how regular folks get hacked.

Without specific numbers, I would estimate that ~50% of Americans have been a victim of a scalable attack (consider that nearly 1 in 2 Americans lost their Social Security Numbers in the 2017 Equifax data breach), but targeted attacks are rare enough to make the news.

## Hackers want your money

This is because most hackers are in it for the money.

The most profitable attacks are the ones that can scale up cheaply and easily, or that get them thousands of passwords in one go.

Every year, Verizon publishes a Data Breach Investigations Report, a report that examines thousands of data breaches across companies around the world. And every year, it's clear: **almost all data breaches are financially-motivated or for espionage** (corporate and government-affiliated). Hacking for fun, ideology, or grudge all trail distantly behind<!-- Verizon DBIR 2018 -->.

<aside class="sidenote">
Or, in Verizon's words:

> So why do the Actors do what they do? Money, loot, cash, filthy lucre,
greed... get the idea?
</aside>

Specifically, 76% of breaches were financially-motivated and 13% for espionage. The remaining 11% were split against fun, ideology, and grudge.

There may have been a time when most hackers did it for the "fun" of it, but that's not the case today. Today, **hackers are just like your average brick-and-mortar criminal**.

This can be reassuring if you don't know what hackers even *want* from you. There are many things to hack and many ways to hack them, but at the end of the day criminals want your money.

Though the LifeLock guy was hacked 13 times after giving out his SSN<!-- TODO cite -->, so I guess don't make yourself a target by daring people to steal your identity.

Or by, uh, writing security advice on the Internet.

## Stealing money isn't as easy as it looks

And this is why the truth---that hackers target everyone---is far less scary than it could be. It's really hard to steal money, even digitally.

Other research<!-- TODO CITE the underground economy & Norton 2018 --><!-- TODO cite Is Everything We Know About Password-Stealing Wrong? --> explores this in greater depth, but at the end of the day there are 3 simple reasons to believe this:

1. Federal law limits your liability for digital fraud---to an absolute maximum of $50 in many cases---and most banks & credit cards offer *zero* liability in most cases.
2. There are billions of hacked passwords and accounts worldwide, but there is simply not that much fraud.<!-- https://haveibeenpwned.com/ vs DOJ fraud rates -->
3. Hacked accounts aren't worth much. Norton estimates that they sell for between 0.5--10% of the account's value<!-- TODO CITE the underground economy & Norton 2018 -->---the account is far from enough to steal money. 

Banks hate fraud in much the same way you do---but they shield you from it. After all, crime is bad for business. They freely pay you back for fraud because they want you to feel safe (and spend money).

Banks lose over $40 million each year to *physical theft*, but you don't hear about it---they write it off and pay you back. It's the same for credit cards. In a survey, 80% of credit card fraud victims lost nothing at all, and 97% lost less than $1000<!-- TODO Synovate -->. Surveys like this are notorious for exaggerating costs, so these numbers are eye-opening.

<!-- TODO that's why non-repudiatable scams are much more common -->

## The other costs

However, you're probably worried about more than just losing money. A "successful" fraud attempt (even one where you get your money back) often costs you time and energy---and it's scary!

The good news: if you catch it early, it will probably be easy to resolve. 69% of folks who discovered fraud within 6 months of the occurence spent less than 10 hours resolving it. It's frustrating and annoying, but hopefully not the end of the world.

That being said, there are many cases where resolving a hack can take months, or more. Bad things can happen, and good cybersecurity on your part can mitigate a lot of them.

But it's good to know that the system protects you, and it's also clear that certain "real world" security practices may help you more than, say, good passwords.

## When hackers go for the hard stuff

This advice also misses one scenario: a hacker who doesn't want your money. These are the hackers with a personal connection---a jealous ex, an angry coworker, a distrustful parent, or even a friend playing a prank.

For most hackers, you are a target simply because they cast a wide net, but in this scenario you are a specific, isolated target. On paper, this is the nightmare that keeps security analysts up at night: these people can know your secrets, have access to your devices, and may even know your passwords.

This is absolutely terrifying, and I will put it clearly:

* **If you are worried about this type of harassment, I do not think this guide is a complete solution for you**.
* If you are being targeted like this, you need to get help from the police ([I'm under attack now](/help/) has more information).

In that case, why am I optimistic about security? Two reasons:

1. This type of hacking is rare enough to make the news when it occurs.
2. I think the advice in this guide serves as a good baseline for protecting yourself against these threats.

Unfortunately, there is very little data about this type of hacking. How frequently are Facebook photos accidentally made public? How often do public records reveal your address or personal information online? Do people often guess their friends' passwords?

It is unclear.

## Stalking, specifically

Even taking cyber-stalking specifically as a stand-in for targeted attacks in general, the data is preliminary and unclear. As TK Logan (a behavioral science professor at the University of Kentucky)<!-- TODO cite--> puts it, "few studies to date have examined the use of technology in partner stalking."

The data we do have suggests that, even among stalking victims, hacking seems rare<!-- TODO cite Stalking victimization in the United States -->. A 2009 report by the DOJ<!-- TODO cite Stalking victimization in the United States (same report) --> found that about 3% of stalking included identity theft (stealing from bank accounts, unauthorized purchases, etc.), and 3% included the use of "computer spyware." That same report reported that 23% of stalking saw unwanted email and IMs.

<aside class="sidenote">
<!-- TODO annual vs total; but a 7-mo period saw ~5%. Research on Partner Stalking: Putting the Pieces Together -->
However, this same study estimates that 1.4% of American adults have been stalked (2% of women; 0.7% of men), but some studies put the intimate partner stalking rate alone at between 5-15% of American woman!

It's clear that any conclusions from this should be considered **extremely preliminary**.
 </aside>

In other words, the data doesn't say much, but it suggests that "targeted hacking" (as we expect it) is not pervasive.

## The big picture

In short, you *are* a target for hackers, if only because they cast a gigantic, all-encompassing net in their search for easy money.

Most hackers don't care about you or your accounts specifically, and it takes more than a hack to steal all your money. It can be frustrating to recover from a hack, and it's scary, but there are ways to get your money back.

Some folks need to worry about more targeted attacks from people they know, but these attacks are not prevalant.

The data indicates straightforward ways to stay safe (some not related to cybersecurity at all!), but in order to understand why, you need to understand how you will be hacked.
