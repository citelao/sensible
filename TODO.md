# TODO

This is a simple list of things I want to come back to.

## Unvetted advice

Unvetted advice from earlier drafts:

2. Use different passwords on each site, managed in a password manager.
4. Encrypt your hard drive.
5. Lock your computer with a password or biometric security.
7. Type passwords only when you're sure no one can see you.
8. Trust your browser more than apps.
9. Be suspicious when weird things happen.
10. Learn how your browser communicates security: [read]({{site.baseurl}}/https/) or [watch](https://youtu.be/RNzw8tVhOpY).
