	<p>I’ve often heard the advice “use a VPN”—a Virtual Private Network. If you’re trying to <a href="/overall">secure your internet traffic</a>, they’re <strong>a good solution to a different problem</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="the-usefulness-of-a-vpn">The usefulness of a VPN</h2>

<p>VPNs are like a “middleman” or PO box for your internet connection: when you use a VPN, you forward all your computer’s internet traffic to the VPN before that VPN sends it to its final destination.</p>

<p>This provides two benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To anything between you and the VPN (like the coffee shop around you), it seems like your computer is talking to the VPN, not the final destination.</li>
  <li>To the final destination, it seems like your traffic is coming from the intermediate computer, not your actual device.</li>
</ul>

<p>And (though it is technically possible to run a VPN without encryption) a VPN encrypts your local traffic, giving a third benefit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To anything between you and the VPN, your traffic is encrypted and appears as “generic VPN traffic.”</li>
</ul>

<p>These three benefits can be helpful.</p>

<p>If you want to access content only available in a certain country, for example, you could use a VPN based in that country.</p>

<p>You can also use a VPN to <strong>protect against local eavesdroppers</strong>. To any eavesdroppers listening to traffic between your computer and the VPN’s servers—for example, a hacker at the table next you—your traffic only appears as “generic VPN traffic”.</p>

<p>VPNs also help companies with large internal networks (intranets). IT departments often set up Internet-facing VPN servers that also connect to the internal network. Employees can access internal services through the VPN, as though they were at work.</p>

<h2 id="the-flaws-of-vpns">The flaws of VPNs</h2>

<p>VPNs are incredibly helpful in specific scenarios (like the ones detailed above). However, most of the time, they are a false sense of security.</p>

<p>VPNs only protect your message until it reaches the VPN server.</p>

<p>If your destination does not use <a href="/https">HTTPS</a>, your messages then travel unencrypted to their final server, and anyone along <em>that</em> path can eavesdrop unimpeeded.</p>

<p>And while VPNs protect your information against local eavesdroppers, every local eavesdropper will <strong>know you are using a VPN</strong>. Your content will be encrypted, but it will be sent in a way that is clearly identifiable as VPN traffic. Nearby hackers won’t know you’re checking out Apple.com, but they <em>will</em> know that you’re being really secretive about <em>something</em>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, using a VPN means <strong>trusting another service</strong>. When you set up a VPN, you send all of your Internet traffic to <em>one company</em>. That company has access to all of the information a coffee-shop eavesdropper would see. If you are using HTTPS, the VPN knows which sites you visit. If you aren’t using HTTPS, the VPN can read everything you send and receive.</p>

<p>VPNs are marketted at people doing shady things. There’s a lot of sleezy marketting and hucksterism, and many claims like “no tracking” and “military-grade encryption” are impossible to verify.</p>

<aside class="sidenote">
  <p>By the way, <strong>military-grade encryption</strong> is meaningless. The military sends email and browses the internet the same way you do. In fact, encryption standards are generally more trusted the <strong>more</strong> public they are.</p>
</aside>

<p>If you’re doing something that HTTPS does not protect, chances are you are doing something that VPNs don’t really protect, either, and <strong>chances are you’re doing something that VPNs would be legally obligated to hand out to law enforcement</strong>.</p>

<p>I feel a bit silly writing this. Don’t do illegal things on the internet. HTTPS and <a href="/overall">my general security advice</a> protects you against most of your daily threats. However, law enforcement has the time, resources, and expertise to break your security. A VPN will not make the difference here.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-people-recommend-vpns">Why do people recommend VPNs?</h2>

<p>If VPNs don’t keep you secure as much as they’re purported to, why do people recommend them? I think there are two main reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>There’s money in it.</strong> Next time you see a VPN article, look who wrote it. Was it a VPN company? You can sell a VPN; you can’t sell HTTPS.</li>
  <li><strong>VPNs mitigate insecure HTTP</strong>. VPNs can’t encrypt insecure sites entirely, but they can protect against local eavesdroppers reading your communication.</li>
  <li><strong>VPNs let you do other things</strong>. By using an American VPN, you can watch American Netflix even if you’re in Kuwait. By using your corporate VPN, you can access company resources at home. VPNs let you appear to other people as though you were the VPN; that has practical benefits sometimes.</li>
</ol>

<p>VPNs have several use cases, and if you know how a VPN will help you do something, by all means use one. But a VPN won’t really make you more secure, most of the time.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>At the end of the day, VPNs are another layer of encryption around your data. This can be helpful, but it also changes the threats you’re open to. If you have a concrete reason to use one, by all means do! But if you’re using one to be more secure—and most of your traffic is HTTPS—consider the tradeoff: an added layer of security with another company to trust.</p>

<p>Consider a VPN when you worry about someone <em>near you</em>, like at your office or in your apartment, snooping on unencrypted traffic, or when you worry about leaking metadata, like that you’re using Skype or going to FoxNews.com.</p>

<p>But keep in mind that using a VPN requires installing software on your computer and sending all of your internet traffic to <em>one company</em>.</p>

<p>This means you need to audit the software to be sure it’s safe, you need to be <em>certain</em> the company isn’t logging your traffic and handing it to someone else, and you need to be ok with everyone around you <em>knowing you’re using a VPN</em>.</p>

<p>I think the better investment is <a href="/https">learning about HTTPS</a> and taking care to use it properly.</p>

<p>But if you need a VPN for a concrete reason, or if you want the extra layer of encryption and are ok with the caveats, a VPN can help.</p>
